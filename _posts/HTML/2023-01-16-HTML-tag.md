# What's a tag?


A tag, often referenced to as _element_ as well, is how we write up our HTML.
There are a lot of available tags with different meanings, let's see the most generic one and how to use them.

## Some generic tags

### `div`

The most generic one, stands for _division_, super usefull to well, divide the page in different sections.

### `span`

<!-- todo: add inline element page -->
Pretty much like a div, except that it is an [inline element].

### `p`

The content is supposed to be text, a _paragraph_ to be specific.

### `img`

As this tag reads, we're going to display an image! Carefull, this is an inline-element.

## Open/close a tag

```html
<p>This "p" tag is now open, let's close it here: </p>
```

> Some tags are autoclosing, let's see how
{: .prompt-warning }

```html
<img href="./../images/my-pic.jpg" alt="cute cat with sunglasses" id="cool-cat" />
```


## Nesting tags

HTML has child-parent relationships and sibling relationships aswell, let's see it with an image:

- The **html** tag is the parent of the **head** tag.
- The **title** tag is a child of the **head** tag.
- **head** and **body** are siblings.

This could be written like so in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My title</title>
    <!-- Notice that meta tags are a bit weird and don't need to be closed. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Some content will go here! -->
  </body>
</html>
```
