# HTML or HyperText Markup Language

HTML is a standardized system for marking up text documents with structure and formatting information. It is used to create and structure content on the web, and is the foundation of all web pages.

Here are the basic building blocks of HTML:

## Elements

HTML is made up of elements, which are represented by tags. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag, with the content of the element placed in between. For example, the element for a paragraph would be represented by the `<p>` tag, and the content of the paragraph would be placed between the opening `<p>` tag and the closing `</p>` tag.

## Attributes

Elements can have additional information added to them through attributes. These are placed within the opening tag of the element and are used to specify additional details about the element. For example, [the `class` attribute]({% link _posts/inner-links/2023-01-16-HTML-class.md %}) is used to specify a class name for an element, it is mainly used to group elements that have similar characteristics or that will be styled in a similar way using CSS.

## Headings

Headings are used to break up the content of a page into sections and sub-sections. There are six levels of headings, ranging from `<h1>` (the largest and most important) to `<h6>` (the smallest and least important).

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are used to contain blocks of text. They are represented by the `<p>` element.

## Links

Links, or hyperlinks, are used to connect one webpage to another. They are created using the `<a>` element, which stands for anchor. The href attribute is used to specify the destination of the link.

## Images

Images can be added to a webpage using the `<img>` element. The `src` attribute is used to specify the location of the image file, and the `alt` attribute is used to provide a text alternative for the image.

## Lists

There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered lists (represented by the `<ol>` element) and unordered lists (represented by the `<ul>` element). Lists are used to group related items and can be nested to create sub-lists.

## Tables

Tables are used to organize data into rows and columns. The `<table>` element is used to create a table, and rows are added using the `<tr>` element. Cells within the rows are added using the `<td>` element (for standard cells) or the `<th>` element (for cells that contain headings).


These are just a few of the basic building blocks of HTML. There are many other elements and attributes that can be used to create and structure content on a webpage.
