# Installation

We should all have mongodb already set up on our machines, if we've followed the prework installation guides.

We should also have a tool called MongoDB Compass.

MongoDB Compass is a database explorer with a visual interface.
We can create, read, update, and delete documents in our database.

Just in case, here are the instructions for installing by operating system.
