DOM selectors allow you to select HTML elements from the DOM, all of the elements have access to different properties / methods.

Here is a small tailored list of the most useful ones:

- `document.querySelector(cssSelector)`
- `document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector)`
- `document.getElementById(id)`
- `document.getElementsByClassName(class)`
  - /!\ You can use all the selectors from the document and from an element previously selected

Accessing an element give you access to it's methods / properties:

- classList
- style
- dataset
- id
