- functions are values
- in JS they can be assigned to a variable and passed around in other variables, as argument to functions
- Composition, passing a function into an other function allow us to compose a lot of small functions into bigger functions.

### Keypoints

- Functions expressions
- Passing functions as arguments (callbacks)
- Create anonymous functions
- Write arrow functions
- Knowing how to use `forEach`, `filter`, `map`...
