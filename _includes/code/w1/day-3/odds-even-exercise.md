# Odds/Even Exercise

Your task is to write a small JavaScript file which prints out twenty lines like the following:

```
1 is odd
2 is even
...
19 is odd
20 is even
```

You should use a loop flow!

## Bonus

Turn it into a fizzbuzz.

If a number divides by 3, say "fizz" instead of the number.

If a number divides by 5, say "buzz" instead of the number.

If a number divides by 3 and 5, say "fizzbuzz" instead of the number.

```
1 is odd
2 is even
fizz is odd
4 is even
buzz is odd
fizz is even
7 is odd
8 is even
fizz is odd
buzz is even
11 is odd
fizz is even
13 is odd
14 is even
fizzbuzz is odd
16 is even
17 is odd

```
